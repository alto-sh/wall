# wall

an experiment in graffiti and who has permission to edit what. this is a site emulating a web browser, allowing you to browse to
pages and graffiti them, much like you would do on an actual wall. any changes you make to a site are global and live, so all other
users can see them. try it out at [wall.novata.ninja](https://wall.novata.ninja).
